## M3_Challenge-Submission
# Crypto Arbitrage

In this Challenge, we've taken on the roles of analysts at a high-tech investment firm. The division vice president (VP) is considering arbitrage opportunities in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As Bitcoin trades on markets across the globe, we studied the opportunity to capitalize on simultaneous price dislocations in those markets by using the powers of Pandas.

For this study, we sorted through historical trade data for Bitcoin on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. We then applied the three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.

This aspect of the study consisted of 3 phases:
   Collect the data.

   Prepare the data.

  Analyze the data.
